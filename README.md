# Flexible Pavements Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning: Supervised Learning with Tree-Based Algorithms

This paper presents the application of supervised machine learning tree-based algorithms to predict the performance of flexible pavements. The International Roughness Index (IRI) was adopted as a pavement performance indicator. Still, the Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost algorithms were used. Finally, the best-trained model was XGBoost, with an R-squared of 0.98 and RMSE of 0.08 for the test sample.

Paper presented at the 5th International Conference on Transport Infrastructure, Lima - Perú, 11-13 August, 2022.
