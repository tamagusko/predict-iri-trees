# Steps:    

1. Import the necessary libraries and read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Explore the data and clean it if necessary. This may include handling missing values, handling outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Preprocess the data by scaling it or applying other transformations as necessary.
5. Train a machine learning model on the training data. Some possible models you could try include linear regression, support vector machines, or decision trees.
6. Evaluate the model on the testing data to see how well it performs.
7. Use the trained model to make predictions for the IRI values for each station, for the desired time periods (3, 5, and 10 years).
